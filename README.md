# Quantum Computing

Discipline of CS that tries to solve the complex problems that could not be solved by supercomputers.
Still in development, quantum hardware and quantum algorithms would be faster than classical computers.

It is based on quantum mechanics (study of subatomic particles).

- Qubits instead of bits: This is called superposition which will eliminate two state (0,1) theory of classical computers.
- Multiple qubits can work simultaneously increasing the efficiency.
- It will create multidimensional computational spaces like molecules (its faster than brute force methods implied by supercomputers)
- Classical computers will be more relevant in case of definite answers.
